ABOUT RAI(Remote Advanced Intelligence) 
======================================== 

Why robots is not a good or worst technology? What technology should be used to replace robots technology?

In the Last chapter of  the  bibble (Revelation 13:15) says
that Robot is  nothing but image of the beast. 

According to bibble book of Revelation...

"Revelation 13:15: The second beast (known as Antichrist-666) was given power to give breath to the image(robot)  of the first beast,
 so that the image(robot)  could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image(robot) to be killed. 
It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark (this mark is the Today biotechnology which is biochip)
 on their right hands or on their foreheads,  17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, 
 which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.18 This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, 
 for it is the number of a man.[e] That number is 666".So we can say robots.
 is the most danger technology in our future. 
 
 This Data science and  machine Learning is noting  but mathematics.
 So only Data science , machine Learning is  good. If we trust in chatbots , chatbots belong to AI technology,there
 is  a chance to  steal the money from your bank account. So due to this demerits ,
 RAI(Remote Advanced Intelligence) is  followed to replace robots.
 So RAI is a new concept invented by Wilmix jemin j at year 2022.This technology will replace
robots and Safegaurd all the users from account stealing,and dangers.
 And this RAI will overtake antichrist technology(robotics) in the future..
 
 
 This RAI ( Remote Advanced Intelligence) consists of
 
 a) DataScience
 b) Machine Learning
 c) Remo concepts used to replace Robots.(that i will explain later).
 d) Advanced business in RAI ( Remote Advanced Intelligence).
 
 I felt thanks for all of my support.
 "We should safegaurd our lives from evil powers and dangers at computer field"

 Note : Even So many righteous people also dislike Robots.
